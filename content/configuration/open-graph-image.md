Available into `_data/libdocConfig.json`:

```json
{
    "ogImageUrl": ""
}
```

The Open Graph Image is a metadata image URL that is displayed when a link to a LibDoc page is shared into a social network. By default, LibDoc configation `ogImageUrl` is used on every page but this parameter can be overridden on each pageâ€™s front matter with the same key `ogImageUrl`. Then you can customize each page of your project.
